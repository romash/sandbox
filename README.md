# Marketplace: Trade offers

Players are able to exchange resources (exchange ratio should be between 1:2 and 2:1).
Please add functionality to create, edit, delete own trade offers.
Player can accept other offers if he/she has enough resources. 

## CoS
1. Create API endpoints to create/edit/delete own offers
2. Create API endpoints to accept offers from other players
3. Create a page so player can create a new offer and see already created offers.
4. Create a page with a list of all active offers from other players
